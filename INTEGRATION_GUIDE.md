# Geoapify Integration for Nearby Colleges

## âœ… **Complete Integration Summary**

The application now shows nearby colleges using the Geoapify API based on the user's current location. Here's how it works:

### **1. HTML Structure (Already Present)**

```html
<div id="nearby-wrapper" class="card" style="display: none">
  <h3>Nearby Colleges For You</h3>
  <p class="muted">We used your location to find colleges within your area.</p>
  <div id="nearby-colleges" class="grid-container"></div>
</div>
```

### **2. Backend Integration (app.py)**

- âœ… Added Geoapify API configuration
- âœ… Created `find_nearby_colleges()` function
- âœ… Integrated with existing `/recommend` endpoint
- âœ… Returns up to 10 nearby colleges with distance, contact info, and categories

### **3. Frontend Integration (script.js)**

- âœ… Automatically gets user location during quiz submission
- âœ… Sends location data to backend
- âœ… Displays nearby colleges from Geoapify API
- âœ… Fallback to local college search if Geoapify fails

### **4. Styling (style.css)**

- âœ… Added special styling for nearby colleges section
- âœ… Gradient background and blue accent border
- âœ… Proper link styling for websites and phone numbers
